      "bio1": "At ESDAC I built strong foundations in Graphic Design, focusing on <span class='bold'>color</span> and <span class='bold'>observational drawing</span>, thanks to inspiring teachers who shaped the way I still see and build images today. During my apprenticeship at France Sport, I learned to adapt quickly to a professional environment, proving <span class='bold'>reliable</span> and <span class='bold'>effective</span> in a fast-moving team.",
      "bio2": "At ArtFx I sharpened my eye across photography, sculpture, painting, drawing, and film/VFX. Working on many group projects taught me to keep workflows <span class='bold'>clean</span>, <span class='bold'>readable</span>, and <span class='bold'>handoff-ready</span>.",
      "bio3": "At Objectif3D I developed my 3D skills and studied <span class='bold'>semiology</span>, learning how images, symbols, and composition guide meaning.",
      "bio4": "I also studied computer science for two years, which gave me a strong sense of <span class='bold'>logic</span> and <span class='bold'>discipline</span> in structuring projects.",
      "bio5": "Finally, at MJM I brought all of this together in Motion Design — applying everything I had learned — and graduated <span class='bold'>with honors</span>."

Denis Villeneuve inspires me for his <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, <span class='bold'>storytelling</span>, and <span class='bold'>composition</span>. <span class='italic'>Dune: Part Two</span> was such a reference for me that I even made a project around it during my studies — its sense of scale and control of pacing are masterful. <span class='italic'>Blade Runner 2049</span> speaks to my love of cyberpunk, with immaculate visuals and a story that flows like music. Villeneuve is a genius of cinematography — every film he releases seems to claim the Oscar for it.",
      "p2": "Tim Burton shaped my taste for <span class='bold'>playful madness</span>. <span class='italic'>Beetlejuice</span> (both 1 and 2) with its delirious mix of animatronics and stop motion, and <span class='italic'>Alice in Wonderland</span> with its sheer fun, show his joy of creation. Yet he can also break your heart, as with <span class='italic'>Edward Scissorhands</span>. He is a master of both humor and storytelling.",
      "p3": "Christopher Nolan is my reference for <span class='bold'>epic tension</span>. <span class='italic'>Dunkirk</span> is my favorite: the sound design and relentless pacing make you feel trapped inside the atrocity of war. With <span class='italic'>The Dark Knight</span>, he mixes suspense, tension, and even humor at the highest level — the Joker remains unforgettable.",
      "p4": "Quentin Tarantino is the undisputed master of <span class='bold'>absurd carnage</span>. <span class='italic'>Pulp Fiction</span>, <span class='italic'>Kill Bill</span>, <span class='italic'>Inglourious Basterds</span>, <span class='italic'>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span> — each shows his talent for <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, dialogue, and violence turned into spectacle.",
      "p5": "Video games taught me just as much. <span class='italic'>Cyberpunk 2077</span> for its <span class='bold'>storytelling</span> and <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, <span class='italic'>Journey</span> for its <span class='bold'>visual composition</span> and purity, and <span class='italic'>Gris</span> for its <span class='bold'>color</span>, <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, <span class='bold'>immersion</span>, and delicate storytelling. Both <span class='italic'>Cyberpunk 2077</span> and <span class='italic'>Gris</span> even made me cry — proof that when rhythm, image, and narrative align perfectly, motion can reach straight into emotion.",
