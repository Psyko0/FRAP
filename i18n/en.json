Villeneuve is a genius of cinematography — every film he releases seems to claim the Oscar for it.",
      "p2": "Tim Burton shaped my taste for <span class='bold'>playful madness</span>. <span class='italic'>Beetlejuice</span> (both 1 and 2) with its delirious mix of animatronics and stop motion, and <span class='italic'>Alice in Wonderland</span> with its sheer fun, show his joy of creation. Yet he can also break your heart, as with <span class='italic'>Edward Scissorhands</span>. He is a master of both humor and storytelling.",
      "p3": "Christopher Nolan is my reference for <span class='bold'>epic tension</span>. <span class='italic'>Dunkirk</span> is my favorite: the sound design and relentless pacing make you feel trapped inside the atrocity of war. With <span class='italic'>The Dark Knight</span>, he mixes suspense, tension, and even humor at the highest level — the Joker remains unforgettable.",
      "p4": "Quentin Tarantino is the undisputed master of <span class='bold'>absurd carnage</span>. <span class='italic'>Pulp Fiction</span>, <span class='italic'>Kill Bill</span>, <span class='italic'>Inglourious Basterds</span>, <span class='italic'>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span> — each shows his talent for <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, dialogue, and violence turned into spectacle.",
      "p5": "Video games taught me just as much. <span class='italic'>Cyberpunk 2077</span> for its <span class='bold'>storytelling</span> and <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, <span class='italic'>Journey</span> for its <span class='bold'>visual composition</span> and purity, and <span class='italic'>Gris</span> for its <span class='bold'>color</span>, <span class='bold'>rhythm</span>, <span class='bold'>immersion</span>, and delicate storytelling.

Beyond visual consistency, the positive feedback from the team — especially regarding the clarity of the templates and the Twitch broadcast assets — highlighted the <span class='bold'>efficiency and scalability</span> of the system. With more time, I would push the <span class='italic'>motion dimension further</span> to strengthen the dynamic aspect of the brand across social and live formats.
